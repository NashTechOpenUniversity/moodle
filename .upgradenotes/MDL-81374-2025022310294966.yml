        A new set of methods has been added to `quiz_structure` to manage overall feedback for grade items:
        - `populate_grade_item_feedbacks`: Loads all overall feedback for each grade item in a specific quiz and groups it by grade item ID. 
        - `get_grade_item_feedbacks`: Retrieves overall feedback for a given quiz ID.
        - `generate_overallfeedback_detail_data`: Generates detailed overall feedback for a given grade item. It returns data in the format:
          [
              { "feedbacktext": "100%", "boundarylabel": "less than or equal to 100%" },
              { "feedbacktext": "90%", "boundarylabel": "less than 90%" },
              ...
          ]
          This data is used to render the feedback details.
        - `delete_grade_item_feedbacks`: Deletes all overall feedback for a given grade item.
      type: improved
    - message: >-
        The service class `delete_grade_items` will now include an additional step to delete all overall feedback after successfully deleting a grade item.
