  @javascript
  Scenario: Report works when there are no attempts
    When I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Responses report" page logged in as teacher
    Then I should see "Attempts: 0"
    And I should see "Nothing to display"
    And I set the field "Attempts from" to "enrolled users who have not attempted the quiz"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Report works when there are attempts
    Given user "student1" has started an attempt at quiz "Quiz 1"
    And user "student1" has checked answers in their attempt at quiz "Quiz 1":
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | 1.0      |
    And user "student1" has checked answers in their attempt at quiz "Quiz 1":
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | 3.0      |
    And user "student1" has checked answers in their attempt at quiz "Quiz 1":
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | 3.14     |
    And user "student1" has finished an attempt at quiz "Quiz 1"

    When I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Responses report" page logged in as teacher
    Then I should see "Attempts: 1"
    And I should see "Student One"
    And I should not see "Student Two"
    And I set the field "Attempts from" to "enrolled users who have, or have not, attempted the quiz"
    And I set the field "Which tries" to "All tries"
    And I press "Show report"
    And "Student OneReview attempt" row "Response 1Sort by Response 1 Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "1.0"
    And "Student OneReview attempt" row "Status" column of "responses" table should contain ""
    And "Finished" row "Grade/100.00Sort by Grade/100.00 Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "33.33"

    And "Student Two" row "Status" column of "responses" table should contain "-"
    And "Student Two" row "Response 1Sort by Response 1 Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "-"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Report does not allow strange combinations of options
    Given I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Responses report" page logged in as teacher
    And the "Which tries" "select" should be enabled
    When I set the field "Attempts from" to "enrolled users who have not attempted the quiz"
